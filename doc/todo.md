# TODO #

## User Configuration ##

- hook in update mechanism (manual / weekly / daily / etc)
- adjust number of suggestions (although chrome may limit it to 5?)

## General ##

- Update parsing logic to play nice weekly pages
- make options page look nice
- Load url in same tab (maybe make user pref as well)
- Add highlighting to the function signatures
- Perhaps overide the default new tab page (to display which host you're pointed at / if the definitions are loaded)
